# FusionDI

**FusionDI** is a lightweight Swift dependency injection library designed to offer a simple and easy-to-use interface for resolving dependencies in your project. This library aims to keep the core functionality minimal while allowing users to inject and manage dependencies in a clean and efficient way.

## Features

- Easy to integrate into existing projects.
- Simple API for registering and resolving services.
- Lightweight and minimalistic, ideal for small projects or learning purposes.

## Installation

To integrate **FusionDI** into your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager, add the following dependency to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Yurssoft/FusionDI", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

## Usage

### Registering Dependencies

You can register a service and its implementation using the following syntax:

```swift
ServiceResolver.shared.register { YourServiceImplementation() as YourServiceProtocol }
```

### Resolving Dependencies

Once a service is registered, you can resolve it anywhere in your project:

```swift
let service = ServiceResolver.shared.resolve(YourServiceProtocol.self)
```

## Note

**Scope features** such as singleton or transient instances were intentionally left out to keep the library simple and straightforward. This library is perfect for smaller projects or for developers who want to experiment with dependency injection without extra complexity.

## Limitations
### Parallel Testing
Dependency injection (DI) relies on shared memory, which can cause issues in concurrent contexts. Specifically, enabling parallel testing may lead to unpredictable results due to shared RAM usage. `ServiceResolver` is a reference type, and although it manages its internal state in a thread-safe manner, multiple concurrent contexts may still result in unexpected behavior. This can happen if dependencies are modified or cleared in one context while another relies on reading that data.

For optimal reliability, it is recommended to disable parallel testing.
